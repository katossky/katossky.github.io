**Why are not all road maps alike?** From bicycle maps to regular free tourist maps, I record and analyse all maps used for finding one's way
{% comment %} How does one make a map?** I decided to start recording and commenting all the maps that would come accross my way. Bicycle maps of cours, since [I do ride the bike quite a lot](/a-ride-on-eurovelo-3), but also more common maps, such as the free tourist maps one can find at the hotel or the regular city map hanging at the bus stop. What do they look like? Do they correctly serve their target audience? What information is represented and what is left aside? So many interesting questions one can ask about a simgle map.{% endcomment %}
