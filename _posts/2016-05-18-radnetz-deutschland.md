    <p class='legend'><strong>*Radnetz*, *dnetz* or *D-netz*, the German national bike network</strong> is taking advantage of the European network, *Eurovelo*. Being quite central in Europe, Germany is indeed crossed by 8 Eurovelo routes out of 15 - only 7 in 2002 when this poster was made. This is an absolute record, more than France with 7 routes and than Poland with 5.</p>

As I was [writing a review](bva-s-adfc-radturenkarte) of the series of cycle map *ADFC&nbsp;Radturenkarten*, I came to discover the German national bike network <!--<span style='display:inline-block'>-->[*Radnetz Deutschland*](http://www.radnetz-deutschland.de/en.html) <!--[![](/img/logos/wikipedia.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Cycling_Network)</span>--> also called *Radnetz*, *dnetz* or *D-netz*.

[According to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Cycling_Network), this network of 12 routes has been lauched in 2002 as part of the National Cycling Plan and the development should continue at least until 2020. Unfortunately both the 2002-2012 and the 2012-2010 plans are in German, and my level of German is to limited to understand administrative recommandations. But if you feel like this is not a problem for you: [here is the way](http://www.bmvi.de//cae/servlet/contentblob/89724/publicationFile/62136/nationaler-radverkehrsplan-2020.pdf).

Being clever, the Germans decided to exploit the synergies with the European network {% include logo.md what='eurovelo' %}. The international network is *de facto* incoporated in the German one: EV2 is mainly D3, EV4 is mainly D5, EV6 is D6, etc. And -- what a surprise! -- [the seventh route of the network](http://www.radnetz-deutschland.de/en/d-routen/d-route-7.html), *Die Pilgerroute*, is the German counterpart of Eurovelo 3, *The Pilgrim way*.

That said, for a network started in 2002, I must say I am not impressed of the result. After more than 10 years, Wikepedia states that "in North Rhine-Westphalia, routes 3, 4, 7, 8 and 9 have been marked in collaboration with  NRW" ([source](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-Route), my traduction). Does it mean that the other routes haven't been marked? If I focus only on ![D7](/img/logos/d7.png)/![EV3](/img/logos/ev3.png), the [dedicated Wikipedia page](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilgerroute_(D7)) says that "the route is parly marked with the D7 logo, but also partly marked with just local direction signs". Brunaud Devillard from [CycloTransEurope](https://www.facebook.com/TransEuropeenne-117055065001991) -- who rode from Copenhagen to Paris last summer -- confirmed that ![D7](/img/logos/d7.png)/![EV3](/img/logos/ev3.png) is mainly unsigned.

The website gives also a weird feeling: [the news](http://www.radnetz-deutschland.de/aktuell-service/news.html), [the Twitter](https://twitter.com/RaDNetz_de) or [the Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/Radnetz.Deutschland) all stopped publishing between May and November 2012. If anyone knows what is going on over there...

But the good news is that *Radnetz*'s website provides the GPS track of each route of the network, and thus in particular the one of Eurovelo 3 in Germany. [If you remember](first-importation-of-the-track), the tracks recovered from OpenStreetMap contain many holes, especially between Bremen and MÃ¼nster. The GPS tracks from *Radnetz* are probably few years old, but it's worth trying to read them! That's what I am going to do [in a next post](importing-the-german-gps-track).
