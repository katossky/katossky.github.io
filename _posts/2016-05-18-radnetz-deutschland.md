As part of [my series of posts about road maps](/blogs/cartotheque), I recently reviewed the collection of cycle maps [*ADFC&nbsp;Radturenkarten*]({% post_url 2016-05-18-bva-s-adfc-radturenkarte %}). Doing so, I came to discover the existence of the German national bike network [*Radnetz Deutschland*](http://www.radnetz-deutschland.de/en.html){: .discreet} also called *Radnetz*, *dnetz* or *D-netz* and depicted by the {% include logo.md what='dnetz' %} logo.

[According to *Wikipedia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Cycling_Network), this network of 12 routes has been launched in 2002 as part of the National Cycling Plan and its development should continue at least until 2020. 

Being clever, the Germans decided to exploit the synergies with the European network *EuroVelo*, which started in the 1990s. The international network is *de facto* incorporated in the German one: route {% include logo.md what='d3' %} follows {% include logo.md what='ev2' %}, route {% include logo.md what='d6' %} is route {% include logo.md what='ev6' %}, etc. And -- what a surprise! -- the seventh route of the network, [*Die Pilgerroute*](http://www.radnetz-deutschland.de/en/d-routen/d-route-7.html), is the German counterpart of *EuroVelo* 3, [*The Pilgrims' Route*](http://www.eurovelo.com/en/eurovelos/eurovelo-3).

	<p class='legend' markdown='1'> The 12 routes of the *Radnetz* are easily recognizable thanks to their catchy logo, as here in Cologne. I could not find any official information about the rate of completion of the network but I have been told that it is far from fully marked. *<a class='discreet' href='https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datei:D-Netz-Route,_Abschnitt_K%C3%B6ln-Poll_,_Rheinaufw%C3%A4rts.jpg'>Photo by Duhon</a> under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" class='discreet'>CC BY 3.0</a>.*</p>

    <p class='legend' markdown='1'>**The German national bike network is taking advantage of the European network, *EuroVelo***. Being quite central in Europe, Germany is indeed crossed by 8 *EuroVelo* routes out of 15 - only 7 in 2002 when this poster was made. This is an absolute record, more than France with 7 routes and than Poland with 5.</p>
</div>

That said, for a network started in 2002, I must say I am not impressed with the result. After more than 10 years, *Wikipedia* states that "in North Rhine-Westphalia, routes 3, 4, 7, 8 and 9 have been marked" ([source](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-Route), my traduction). Does it mean that the other routes haven't been marked? If I focus only on route {% include logo.md what='d7' %}, the [dedicated *Wikipedia* page](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilgerroute_(D7)) says that "the route is partly marked with the D7 logo, but also partly marked with just local direction signs" (my traduction). Brunaud Devillard from {% include logo.md what='cyclotrans-europe' %} -- [who rode from Copenhagen to Paris last summer](http://eurovelo3.fr/copenhague-paris) -- confirmed that {% include logo.md what='d7' %} is mainly unsigned.

*dnetz*'s website gives also a weird feeling: [the news](http://www.radnetz-deutschland.de/aktuell-service/news.html){: .discreet}, [the Twitter](https://twitter.com/RaDNetz_de){: .discreet} or [the Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/Radnetz.Deutschland){: .discreet} all stopped publishing between May and November 2012. Information about the advancement of the network can surely be found as part of the 2012-2020 National Cycling Plan. But unfortunately, both are in German, and my level of German is too limited to understand administrative or technical considerations<label for="sn-help" class="sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-help"/><span class='sidenote'>If this is not a problem for you, <a href="http://www.bmvi.de//cae/servlet/contentblob/89724/publicationFile/62136/nationaler-radverkehrsplan-2020.pdf">here</a> is the 2012-2020 National Cycling Plan as PDF. Please share your findings with me!</span>.

But the good news is that *dnetz*'s website provides the GPS track of each route of the network. As you may know, I am in the process of [building a journey planner for *The Pilgrims' Route*](/blogs/journey-planner-the-making-of). The GPS tracks from *Radnetz* are probably a few years old, but it is worth trying to read them, waiting for an even better source of data<label for="sn-better-data" class="sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-better-data"/><span class='sidenote'>I have now (03/06/2016) found an extensive track for the whole <em>Pilgrims' Route</em> on <a href="http://www.biroto.eu/en/cycle-route/europe/eurovelo-pilgrims-route-ev3/rt00000408">Biroto</a>.</span>.
