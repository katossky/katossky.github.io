This summer, I plan to do a big ride on the cycle route "The Pilgrim Road", Eurovelo {% include logo.md what='ev3' %}, from [Trondheim](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trondheim){: .discreet} in Norway to [Santiago-de-Compostella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_de_Compostela){: .discreet} in Spain. <!-- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2017001/adding-a-class-attribute-to-a-hyperlink-in-markdown#3062435 -->

I really like travelling by bike: it has right speed to make long distance travels. You can stop at any time if you see something interesting, without thinking about where to park, how not to block the traffic or whether you are going to make it to the the next gas station. In the same time, you are not bound to planning everything, as when you are a pedestrian. You can improvise and an additional 10 km is always possible, if for instance you believe the hotel you planned to sleep at is not worth a night under the tent into the wild.

I did not choose route {% include logo.md what='ev3' %} randomly. The main reason for my choice is that it is the only route in the {% include logo.md what='eurovelo' %} network which goes through Paris. I have lived in Paris many years, and I miss all my friends there. Additionnally, Paris during the summer is lovely: all cars are gone, because Parisians themselves are on holiday.

An other reason for choosing Eurovelo {% include logo.md what='ev3' %} (and not, for instance, Eurovelo {% include logo.md what='ev6' %}, from Nantes in France to Constanța in Romania, which is following the Loire river just over 100 kms south of Paris) is my will to "go south" after a few years living in the cold Copenhagen. Starting relatively close to the Artic Circle in July, I will perform my own form of migration.

Lastly, I also wanted to visit Jutland, the "continental Denmark", and it happens that Eurovelo {% include logo.md what='ev3' %} actually runs from [Frederikshavn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederikshavn){: .discreet} in the North of Jutland, to [Åbenrå](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aabenraa){: .discreet} in the south. I know many Copenhageners who never go to Jutland, or to only a few towns there. Knowing a country better than (most of) its citizens feels like a small victory. And I may even have the occasion to visit <a class='discreet' href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legoland_Billund">Legoland</a>, which stands on a fair 10 km detour from the Pilgrim Road.
