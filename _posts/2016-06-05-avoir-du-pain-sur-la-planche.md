**Avoir du pain sur la planche** is a French expression translating litterally to *to have bread on one's board* and meaning *to have much to do*. It is used for underlining that a project, an activity, usually explained in detail just beforehands, is still in a early phase of development and requires hard work.

## The history

The meaning of the expression was completely reversed through time. Originally, *to have bread on one's board* transparently meant *to have worked enough and be able to relax* and even at some point evolved to the sense of *to be rich enough not to have to work*<label for="sn-littre" class="sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-littre"/><span class='sidenote'>It is still [the meaning](http://www.littre.org/definition/pain#var4) given by the [*Dictionnaire de la langue française*](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionnaire_de_la_langue_fran%C3%A7aise){: .discreet}, the dictionary of Classical French started by Émile Littré in the XIX<sup>th</sup> century and still a reference today.</span>. Today, it means the exact opposite, *not to be able to stay idle because of all the work one have to do instead*.

## The conversation

> **Person A:** How is it going with [your bike trip]({% post_url 2016-01-01-the-pilgrims-route %})?
> 
> **Person B:** Oh, well but busy. As if it was not enough to prepare the trip itself, I also decided [to create a website]({% post_url 2016-01-20-a-planner-for-the-pilgrims-route %}) for helping people to organise their trips on the *EuroVelo* network. I just wrote a list of all the features I want to implement. 6 of them represent the bare minimum for my project to be usefull, and have to be implemented before my departure in less than 30 days. In short, *j'ai du pain sur la planche.*

  <p class='remark' markdown='1'>I can not think of any French expression conveying the exact opposite meaning to *avoir du plain sur la planche*. Maybe *prendre un repos bien mérité*? (*to deserve a rest*)</p>
