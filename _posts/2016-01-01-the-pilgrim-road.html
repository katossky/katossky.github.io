<p>This summer, I plan to do a big ride on the cycle road Eurovelo 3, <a href="http://www.eurovelo.com/fr/eurovelos/eurovelo-3"><em>The Pilgrim Road</em></a>, from Trondheim in Norway to Santiago-de-Compostella in Spain.</p>

<p>I really like travelling by bike, I think it is the right amount of speed to make long distance travels. You can stop at any time if you see something interesting, without thinking about where to park, how not to block the traffic or whether you're gonna make it before the the next gazoline station. In the same time, you're not bound to planning everything, as when you are a pedestrian. You can improvise and an additional 10 km is always possible, if for instance you beleive the hotel you planned to sleep at is not worth a night under the tent into the wild.</p>

<p>I did not chose Eurovelo 3 randomly. The main reason for my choice is that it is the only route in the [Eurovelo network](http://www.eurovelo.com) which goes through Paris. I have lived in Paris many years, and I miss all my friends there. Additionnally, Paris during the summer is lovely: all cars are gone, because parisians themselves are on holyday.</p>

<p>An other reason for choosing Eurovelo 3 (and not, for instance, Eurovelo 6, from Nantes in France to Constanța in Romania, which is following the Loire river just over 100 kms south of Paris) is my will to "go south" after a few years living in Copenhagen. Starting relatively close to the artic circle in July and move south, I will perform my own migration.</p>

<p>Lastly, I also wanted to visit Jutland, the "continental Denmark", and it happens that Eurovelo 3 actually runs from Frederikshavn in the North of Jutland, to Åbenrå in the south. I know many copenhageners who never go to Jutland, or to only a few towns there. Knowing a country better than (most of) its citizens feels like a small victory. And I may even have the occasion to visit [Legoland](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legoland_Billund), which stands on a fair 10 km detour from the Pilgrim Road.</p>
